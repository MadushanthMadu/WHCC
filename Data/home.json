Our school was started in 1954 under the name of 'Vivekananda Vidyalaya' with the motto 'Vaiyanthorum Deivam Tholu' by S.K.Wijayaratnam who is the founder of this school. In 1964 an arrangement was made to call it 'Wijayaratnam Maha Vidyalaya'. It was later upgraded in 1993 to 'Wijayaratnam Central College'. Our school, which has grown in this way, is today a 1AB type school where students in the fields of science, mathematics, business, commerce and the arts are making their mark as professors, teachers, doctors, engineers, scientists and today in the field of technology."
